# Pacman
By Andrew Kalb

This is an unfinished project (missing multiple stages, some sound effects, ending sequence).

Developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and heavily relying upon the SFML library.

To run this program:
 - Download the "Pacman" folder and run the "Pacman.exe" executable inside.
